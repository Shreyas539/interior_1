        <h3>Self-Healing Concrete: Biological Method</h3>
        <p>
          Even though it is possible to reduce the extent of cracking by
          available modern technology, remediation of cracks in concrete has
          been the subject of research for many years. There are a large number
          of products available commercially for repairing cracks in concrete:
          structures epoxy, resins, epoxy mortar and other synthetic mixtures.
          Cracks and fissures are a common problem in building structures,
          pavements, and historic monuments. We have introduced a novel
          technique in fixing cracks with environmentally friendly biological
          processes that is a continuous self-remediating process. In the study,
          Bacillus pasteurii that is abundant in soil has been used to induce
          CaCO3 precipitation. It is therefore vital to understand the
          fundamentals of microbial participation in crack remediation.
          Definition The "Bacterial Concrete" is a concrete which can be made by
          embedding bacteria in the concrete that are able to constantly
          precipitate calcite. This phenomenon is called microbiologically
          induced calcite precipitation. It has been shown that under favorable
          conditions for instance Bacillus Pasteurii, a common soil bacterium,
          can continuously precipitate a new highly impermeable calcite layer
          over the surface of an already existing concrete layer. The favorable
          conditions do not directly exist in a concrete but have to be created.
        </p>
        <p>
          The selection of the bacteria is depended on the survive capability of
          bacteria in the alkaline environment. Most of the microorganisms die
          in an environment with pH value of 10 or above. Strains of the
          bacteria genus Bacillus will be found to succeed in high alkaline
          environment. The bacteria survive in the high alkaline environment
          that formed spores comparable to the plant seeds. The spores are of
          very thick wall and they activated when concrete start cracking and
          water transude into the structure. The pH of the highly alkaline
          concrete lowers to the values in the range 10 to 11.5 where the
          bacterial spores become activated.
        </p>
        <h3>DEFINITION –</h3>
        <p>
          Self-healing concrete is a concrete which heals itself when it comes
          in contact with air and water, it produces lime on outer layer of
          concrete.
        </p>
        <div class="blog-content-sub-numers">
          <p>
            In most of the traditional concrete mixtures 20-30% of the cement is
            left unhydrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            If cracking of the concrete occurs, unreacted cement grains may
            become exposed to moisture penetrating the crack.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that case the hydration process may start again and hydration
            products may fill up and heal the crack
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Ferdinand Cohn (1828-1898), a pioneer in the developmental biology of
          lower plants, considerably promoted the taxonomy and physiology of
          bacteria, discovered the heat-resistant endospores of bacilli, and was
          active in applied microbiology.
        </p>
        <h3>1.2 Classification</h3>
        <h3>1.2.1 Autogenous Self-Healing</h3>
        <p>
          The autogenous self-healing depends on most part of advanced hydration
          of concrete, carbonation of calcium hydroxide as well as another
          binder while. The autogenous self-healing is a traditional and famous
          method of concrete that occurred because of:

        <h3>1.2.2 Autonomous Self-Healing Concrete</h3>
        <p>
          Autonomous self-healing concrete entirely relied on manual method that
          operates manually. The autonomous self-healing is been identify
          through a special terminology such as:

          <p>5. The shape memory alloy method;</p>
          <p>6. The microwave method and/or induction energy</p>
        </div>
        <h3>4. Preparation and Processes of Self-Healing Concrete</h3>
        <p>
          There are many processes of self-healing concrete technologies which
          are given below:
        </p>
        <div class="blog-content-sub-numers">
          <p>(i) Natural process;</p>
          <p>(ii) Chemical process;</p>
          <p>(iii) Biological process.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>4.1 Natural Self-healing process</h3>
        <p>
          Some processes can partly fix concrete fracture in natural methods.
          Following are the four processes that can block cracks in concretes:
        </p>
        <div class="blog-content-sub-numers">
          <p>
            1. The development of CaC03 or Ca0H is another method to prevent
            crack
          </p>
          <p>2. Crack is obstructed by impurities in the carriage of water</p>
          <p>
            3. Crack is further obstructed by hydration of the unreacted cement.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Crack is impeded by the enlargement of hydrated cementitious
            pattern in the crack loins (such as the lump of calcium silicate
            hydrate gel).
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>4.2 Chemical self-healing process</h3>
        <p>
          Chemical healing process mainly refers to the artificial healing by
          injecting chemical compounds into the crack for healing. Self-healing
          concrete is designed by mixing chemical liquid regents (i.e., glue)
          with fresh concrete in small containers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two common chemical methods that make use of glue addition to the
          concrete for healing purposes:
        </p>
        <div class="blog-content-sub-numers">
          <p>(1) Hollow pipettes and vessel networks containing glue</p>
          <p>(2) Encapsulated glue.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>4.3 Biological self-healing process</h3>
        <p>
          The use of microorganisms to design self-healing concrete has been
          categorized as biological strategy by several researchers.
          Microorganisms can grow almost everywhere such as soil, water and oil
          reservoir, acidic hot springs and industrial wastewater.
          Microorganisms are mostly divided into three important categories:
          bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Among these microorganisms, special
          strains of bacteria capable of precipitating certain chemicals are
          used to design the biological self-healing concrete. Precipitation of
          polymorphic iron-aluminum-silicate ((Fe5AI3) (SiAl)Ol0(OH)5) and
          calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are the most important processes use for
          designing the biological self-healing concretes. The process of
          calcite precipitation is influenced by the decomposition of urea by
          bacteria, with aid of the bacterial urease enzyme. As a result of
          metabolism of bacteria species give urease, that catalyses’ urea to
          ammonia and carbonate. Further these components hydrolyze to carbonic
          acid and ammonium chloride that leads to the formation of calcium
          carbonate (calcite crystal).

        </div>

        <h3>4.4Self-Healing Concrete Preparation</h3>
        <p>Bacterial concrete is prepared in two ways;</p>

        <div class="blog-content-sub-numers">
          <p>1. By direct application method</p>
          <p>2. By encapsulation method</p>
        </div>

        <h3>4.4.1By direct application method:</h3>
        <p>
          In this direct method, the bacterial spores and calcium lactate are
          directly added into the concrete after the mixing process.
        </p>
        <h3>4.4.2By encapsulation method:</h3>
        <p>
          In this method, the bacterial spores and calcium lactate are placed
          together in clay pellets and these are mixed in the concrete at 6% of
          the total concrete mixture.
        </p>
        <h3>Main Approaches and Their Mechanism</h3>
        <p>
          There are many approaches to create smart concrete and enhance its
          properties while reducing the cost of overall use of the material.
          Many of these approaches were dedicated to create SHC; two of the main
          approaches have proved to be efficient and easy to use.
        </p>

        <h3>Bacteria-Based Healing Process</h3>
        <p>
          Also known as Bio-Concrete; this kind of concrete uses a simple
          process to close the formed crack. The main mechanism is achieved by
          making a concrete mixture that contains
        </p>
        <div class="blog-content-sub-numers">
          <p>(i) a precursor like calcium lactate (Ca(C3H5O2)2).</p>
          <p>
            (ii) bacteria planted in micro capsules (or just added to the
            mixture) that will later germinate, once the water reaches the
            crack. As soon as the bacteria germinate, they produce limestone
            (CaCo3) caused by the multiplying bacteria. Dr. Richard Cooper of
            Bath's Department of Biology & Biochemistry says that incorporating
            bacteria in concrete adds a double layer shield in order to prevent
            corrosion in steel. Not to mention that it employs oxygen present
            which would then benefit the process of steel corrosion. The
            bacteria which are applied in this kind of concrete are
            Spore-forming and alkali-resistant bacteria. Bacteria from this
            group are the most suitable as they are spore-forming and can live
            for more than 200 years in dry conditions. Therefore, using bacteria
            as a healing mechanism is one of the best mechanisms to produce this
            kind of concrete because of its sustainable organic properties.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Shape Memory Polymers</h3>
        <p>
          New smart materials (SMP) that are capable of returning to their
          initiative state by changing back their form upon applying a stimulus.
          This mechanism employs both the autogenic and autonomic principles. It
          uses a man-made system to increase the natural autogenic healing and
          seal cracks in concrete. This kind of polymers is semi-crystalline
          polymers that have a predefined shape memorized in their structure
          that later helps the polymers to go back to their original state. When
          a crack occurs, the system will be triggered, hence, the shape memory
          polymer within the crack gets activated through heating which can be
          in the form of direct heat, or an electrical current. As soon as it’s
          activated, the shape memory effect or shrinkage takes place, and due
          to the restrained nature of the tendon, a tensile force is generated,
          hence the crack closes on itself. After that, the autogenous healing
          starts taking place.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the cracks are formed in the concrete, the moisture will come in
          contact with the calcium and bacteria in the concrete.
        </p>

        <h3>4.5 Factors That Affect the Use of Self-Healing Concrete</h3>

        <p>
          There are many factors that intervene with the usage of this kind of
          concrete. As it is noticed; it is not yet used in all new
          constructions as it is still being under development. Recently
          Self-healing bacteria-based concrete has been successfully tested on a
          full-scale in the University of Bath in the UK However, the cost of
          using it is still not determined as it is hard to predict a full cost.
          The cost efficiency is one of the most important factors and will
          determine whether the material will have limited usage restricted to
          spots that are hard to fix and important constructions such as bridges
          and highways. Other than cost, long-term efficiency is one of the
          important factors as well alongside the size of the formed cracks
          which must not exceed 150 millimeters of depth to establish an ideal
          result. All in all, some factors that will definitely determine
          whether SHC will be used as a replacement of concrete are; the
          economical factor, long-term efficiency, prospect suppliers and safety
          factors.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is still ongoing research regarding SHC; many scientists are
          trying different approaches that ensure the same outcome which is
          closing cracks with minimum intervention while keeping cost at
          reasonable rates. SHC is much more effective than concrete; A brief
          comparison of some aspects is tackled below.
        </p>
        <h3>Safety:</h3>
        <p>
          Since cracks in SHC are easy to close with no extra costs being added,
          the general safety of a particular construction is increased. However,
          that leaves a question regarding the resistant ability of concrete and
          whether crack closing would affect its strength. All research
          conducted so far show that the concrete gains about 25% of its
          original strength in the healed spot which more than the 15% gained
          back when the crack is sealed by current methods.
        </p>
        <h3>Cost:</h3>
        <p>
          It is obvious that the initial cost of construction using SHC is
          higher, however, on the long-term, durable concrete is much more
          cost-efficient due to the low cost of maintenance, durability and the
          long life-span of the construction.
        </p>
        <h3>Durability:</h3>
        <p>
          According to research and experimentation bacteria-based SHC is denser
          and more durable than concrete.
        </p>
        <h3>Availability:</h3>
        <p>
          As it is still under development, this kind of concrete is used on a
          limited scale and still not commercially wide-spread. Some main
          obstacles are cost and production.
        </p>
        <h3>Architecture & Design:</h3>
        <p>
          By increasing the life-span of a construction, architects need to
          re-consider design standers. A long life-span impacts the design of
          any construction, as architects must take into consideration future
          prognosis of two main aspects:
        </p>

        <div class="blog-content-sub-numers">
          <p>
            (i) the potential function within a particular building (potential
            technological needs, change of function, change of life style, etc.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (ii) The future function of urban space surrounding a certain
            building. Hence, architects’ main task is to foresee the upcoming
            needs and the current ones to design and construct a useful,
            aesthetic and more importantly, highly-flexible buildings in order
            to be change function easily. Environmental impact: Cement industry
            is one of the main two producers of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions,
            which is directly harming our planet. Therefore, by using SHC the
            carbon dioxide emissions are reduced significantly.
